# MCP Server PRP System Implementation Plan

## Purpose

Build a complete PRP (Product Requirement Prompt) flow specifically designed for creating MCP servers using this codebase as the foundation. This system will enable developers to extremely easily get started with building production-ready MCP servers using Claude Code.

## Core Objectives

1. **Streamlined MCP Development**: Provide a structured approach to build MCP servers with authentication, database integration, and production deployment
2. **Context-Rich PRPs**: Leverage the proven patterns from this codebase to create comprehensive implementation prompts
3. **One-Pass Success**: Enable developers to create working MCP servers through single PRP execution with Claude Code
4. **Best Practices Integration**: Incorporate July 2025 Claude Code patterns (TodoWrite usage, parallel tool calls, CLAUDE.md documentation)

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core PRP Commands

**Files to Create:**

- `.claude/commands/prp-mcp-create.md` - Creates MCP server PRPs with deep research
- `.claude/commands/prp-mcp-execute.md` - Executes MCP server PRPs with validation

**Key Features:**

- Specialized research for MCP/Cloudflare Workers/OAuth patterns
- Integration with existing `prp_mcp_server.md` template
- TodoWrite-driven task management following 2025 best practices
- Comprehensive validation gates for MCP server development

### Phase 2: Enhanced Documentation

**Files to Create:**

- `PRPs/ai_docs/mcp_patterns.md` - Core MCP development patterns
- `PRPs/ai_docs/cloudflare_workers_setup.md` - Workers deployment patterns
- `PRPs/ai_docs/oauth_integration.md` - Authentication flow documentation

**Purpose:**

- Provide rich context for PRP generation
- Document common MCP server patterns and gotchas
- Enable AI agents to reference proven implementation approaches

### Phase 3: Validation & Testing Framework

**Enhancements:**

- Extend validation loops with MCP-specific tests
- Add MCP Inspector integration testing
- Claude Desktop configuration validation
- Production deployment verification

### Phase 4: Integration & Optimization

**Integration Points:**

- Seamless workflow with existing PRP base system
- Parallel processing for research and implementation
- Error recovery patterns for MCP-specific failures
- Performance optimizations for large MCP server projects

## Success Metrics

- **Developer Onboarding**: New developers can create working MCP servers in under 30 minutes
- **One-Pass Success Rate**: 90%+ PRP execution success without manual intervention
- **Production Readiness**: Generated MCP servers include authentication, error handling, and monitoring
- **Client Compatibility**: Generated servers work with Claude Desktop, Cursor, and MCP Inspector

## Technical Approach

### Research Integration

- Leverage existing research patterns from `prp-base-create.md`
- Add MCP-specific research for tools, authentication, and deployment
- Integration with Cloudflare Workers documentation and patterns

### Validation Framework

- Multi-level validation from syntax to production deployment
- MCP-specific testing with Inspector and client integration
- Authentication flow validation
- Database integration testing (when applicable)

### Context Management

- Rich documentation pipeline through `ai_docs/` directory
- Integration with existing codebase patterns
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery documentation

## Deliverables

1. **Core Commands** (Phase 1)
   - `prp-mcp-create.md` - MCP server PRP creation
   - `prp-mcp-execute.md` - MCP server PRP execution

2. **Documentation Library** (Phase 2)
   - MCP patterns and best practices
   - Cloudflare Workers setup guides
   - OAuth integration documentation

3. **Validation Suite** (Phase 3)
   - MCP server testing framework
   - Client integration validation
   - Production deployment checks

4. **Integration Package** (Phase 4)
   - Complete workflow documentation
   - Performance optimization
   - Error recovery patterns

## Implementation Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Core PRP commands (Immediate)
- **Phase 2**: Documentation library (Week 1)
- **Phase 3**: Validation framework (Week 2)
- **Phase 4**: Integration & optimization (Week 3)

## Quality Gates

- All commands follow existing PRP patterns
- Integration with TodoWrite tool for task management
- Comprehensive validation loops for MCP development
- Production-ready output with authentication and monitoring
- Compatibility with July 2025 Claude Code best practices
